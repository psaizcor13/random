in software that you create (“Derived Software”), and include SDK object
code in Derived Software;

Use SDK source code, SDK object code, and Derived Software for your own
personal, noncommercial use;

Distribute Derived Software and SDK documentation to others, provided that any
distribution is for noncommercial purposes only, is without charge or fee or

and is bound by the terms of this SDK License.

3.2 You agree that UnaiPutoAmo or third parties own all legal right, title and
interest in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that
subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights

all other proprietary rights. UnaiPutoAmo reserves all rights not expressly granted
to you.

separate license agreement are governed solely by the terms of that separate
license agreement and not this License Agreement.

3.5 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that UnaiPutoAmo provides may
change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be
incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You
agree that UnaiPutoAmo may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or
any features within the SDK) to you or to users generally at UnaiPutoAmo's sole
discretion, without prior notice to you.

certain usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique

they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the SDK will

access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that
UnaiPutoAmo is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources.
You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through
such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from
which they originated and that UnaiPutoAmo is not liable for any loss or damage that
you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
applications, data, content, or resources.

6.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you
through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property
rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on
their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create
derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or
in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the
relevant owners.

6.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data,
content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the
